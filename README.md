# Qnut - Detect Wheel Imbalances with Your Smartphone

Qnut is a web application that helps you detect potential wheel imbalances in your vehicle using your smartphone's built-in sensors.

## üì± How It Works

1. **Measure Vibrations**: Mount your smartphone securely on a hard surface in your vehicle. The app uses your phone's accelerometer to detect vibrations while driving. Imbalanced wheels create distinctive vibration patterns that vary with speed.

2. **Analyze & Visualize**: Qnut processes vibration data and displays it as a spectrogram, showing frequency patterns across different speeds to help identify potential wheel issues.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety First

- **NEVER operate Qnut while driving**
- Always have a passenger handle the app during measurements
- Securely mount your phone to prevent it from moving
- Drive safely and follow all traffic laws
- This tool provides indicators only - consult a professional mechanic for diagnosis

## üìã Requirements

- A smartphone with motion sensors (accelerometer)
- GPS capability for speed detection
- Secure phone mount in your vehicle with as little damping as possible
- A passenger to operate the app
